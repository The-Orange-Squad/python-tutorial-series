# Try This (tutorial 3)

1. Concatenate the following strings after converting them from integers to strings:

```py
num1 = 54394
num2 = 587

result = str(num1) + str(num2)
print(result)
```

2. Try to figure out what this does:

```py
print("hello, ".upper() + "WORLD!".lower())
```

3. (Similar to the exercise in the video) Create a variable named `num` and assign the value `10` to it. Also, create another variable named `text` and assign the value `"5"` to it. Then, convert both variables to strings and concatenate them. Assign the result to a new variable named `result` and print it to the console.
