# Try this (tutorial 2)

1. Write a little story about yourself using variables and string concatenation. Sample:

```py
name = "John"
age = 25

print("Hello, my name is " + name + ".")
print("I am " + str(age) + " years old.")
print("I am learning Python.")
```

2. Calculate without printing the result immediately. Sample:

```py
num1 = 54394
num2 = 587

result = num1 * num2
print(result)
```
